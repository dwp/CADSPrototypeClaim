        <h1>Carer's Allowance: self-employment details needed</h1>
            <p>Your application for Carer's allowance has been received.</p>

    <h3>What you need to do next?</h3>
        <p>You said you had income from self-employment when you applied for Carer's Allowance.</p>
        <p>To complete your application you must now give details of the money that came in and out of your business since 6 April 2014.</p>
        <p>You have 2 weeks to send this information. You'll need:</p>
        <p>- details of your business costs and payments since 6 April 2014 your business bank account statements may help with this </p>
        <p>- the amounts of any pension you've paid into</p>
        <p>You can send this information online <a href="cadsLoginselfemployed.html".>www.carersallowancesubmitself-employment.co.uk</a></p>
